<h2>News for version 1.1</h2>

<p>
Fixed a bug in the chd_pc algorithm and reorganized tests.

<section>
<h2>News for version 1.0</h2>

<p>
This is a bugfix only version, after which a revamp of the cmph code and
algorithms will be done.

<h2>News for version 0.9</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="chd.html">The CHD algorithm</a>, which is an algorithm that can be tuned to generate MPHFs that require approximately 2.07 bits per key to be stored. The algorithm outperforms <a href="bdz.html">the BDZ algorithm</a> and therefore is the fastest one available in the literature for sets that can be treated in internal memory.
</li>
<li><a href="chd.html">The CHD_PH algorithm</a>, which is an algorithm to generate PHFs with load factor up to <em>99 %</em>. It is actually the CHD algorithm without the ranking step. If we set the load factor to <em>81 %</em>, which is the maximum that can be obtained with <a href="bdz.html">the BDZ algorithm</a>, the resulting functions can be stored in <em>1.40</em> bits per key. The space requirement increases with the load factor.
</li>
<li>All reported bugs and suggestions have been corrected and included as well.
</li>
</ul>

<section>
<h2>News for version 0.8</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="bdz.html">An algorithm to generate MPHFs that require around 2.6 bits per key to be stored</a>, which is referred to as BDZ algorithm. The algorithm is the fastest one available in the literature for sets that can be treated in internal memory.
</li>
<li><a href="bdz.html">An algorithm to generate PHFs with range m = cn, for c &gt; 1.22</a>, which is referred to as BDZ_PH algorithm. It is actually the BDZ algorithm without the ranking step. The resulting functions can be stored in 1.95 bits per key for <em>c = 1.23</em> and are considerably faster than the MPHFs generated by the BDZ algorithm.
</li>
<li>An adapter to support a vector of struct as the source of keys has been added. 
</li>
<li>An API to support the ability of packing a perfect hash function into a preallocated contiguous memory space. The computation of a packed function is still faster and can be easily mmapped.
</li>
<li>The hash functions djb2, fnv and sdbm were removed because they do not use random seeds and therefore are not useful for MPHFs algorithms.
</li>
<li>All reported bugs and suggestions have been corrected and included as well.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>News for version 0.7</h2>

<ul>
<li>Added man pages and a pkgconfig file.
</li>
</ul>

<hr class="light">

</section>
<section>
<h2>News for version 0.6</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="fch.html">An algorithm to generate MPHFs that require less than 4 bits per key to be stored</a>, which is referred to as FCH algorithm. The algorithm is only efficient for small sets.
</li>
<li>The FCH algorithm is integrated with <a href="brz.html">BRZ algorithm</a> so that you will be able to efficiently generate space-efficient MPHFs for sets in the order of billion keys.
</li>
<li>All reported bugs and suggestions have been corrected and included as well.
</li>
</ul>

<hr class="light">

</section>
<section>
<h2>News for version 0.5</h2>

<ul>
<li>A thread safe vector adapter has been added.
</li>
<li><a href="brz.html">A new algorithm for sets in the order of billion of keys that requires approximately 8.1 bits per key to store the resulting MPHFs.</a> 
</li>
<li>All reported bugs and suggestions have been corrected and included as well.
</li>
</ul>

<section>
<h2>News for version 0.4</h2>

<ul>
<li>Vector Adapter has been added.
</li>
<li>An optimized version of bmz (bmz8) for small set of keys (at most 256 keys) has been added.
</li>
<li>All reported bugs and suggestions have been corrected and included as well.
</li>
</ul>

<hr class="light">

<section>
<h2>News for version 0.3</h2>

<ul>
<li>New heuristic added to the bmz algorithm permits to generate a mphf with only
  <em>24.80n + O(1)</em> bytes. The resulting function can be stored in <em>3.72n</em> bytes.
